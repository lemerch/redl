2.the latest version is 0.07 Betta (Demo).
3.the goal is to increase the speed of writing code by simplifying the programming system and automating the compiler.

# The process of language RedL:

1.The preprocessor:

a)Performs the function of creating an intermediate file with extracted files and recording their descriptions. 
b)Preparing program arguments and then passing "To the interpreter".

2.Translator:

a) Determining the type of translation (which language to translate [c++/electron]).
b) checking the correctness of the file.
c) Translating command structures according to the selected mode. The output of the error structures of the teams.
d) Preparing the translated file for compilation/interpretation.
e) syntax matching check (RedL) for variables and functions.
f) running the compiler (c++/electron-packager).
g) Reverse translation of errors (c ++ /Electron to RedL, if any) and their subsequent output.
